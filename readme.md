## Docs

Working on the docs. You can find an [overview on the SilverStripe blog](http://www.silverstripe.org/blog/superglue-your-pages)!

## Tests

Working on the tests. So far they've been rolled into the first site this was used on, and we're in the process of extracting them...

## Versioning

This library follows [Semver](http://semver.org). According to Semver, you will be able to upgrade to any minor or patch version of this library without any breaking changes to the public API. Semver also requires that we clearly define the public API for this library.

All methods, with `public` visibility, are part of the public API. All other methods are not part of the public API. Where possible, we'll try to keep `protected` methods backwards-compatible in minor/patch versions, but if you're overriding methods then please test your work before upgrading.

## Reporting Issues

Please [create an issue](http://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-superglue/issues) for any bugs you've found, or features you're missing.
